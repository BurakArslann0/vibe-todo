## Part 2: Comparative Analysis

Traditional code completion tools focus on predicting the next few tokens or lines of code based on local context. While helpful for speed, they lack understanding of the overall project structure or developer intent.

Vibe coding tools go beyond autocomplete by understanding the entire codebase. They can modify multiple files, suggest architecture changes, and generate complete features from high-level instructions. For example, instead of completing a single function, a vibe coding tool can build an entire Todo application with persistence and UI logic.

Compared to GitHub Copilot, vibe coding tools provide a more conversational and interactive workflow. Copilot mainly assists line-by-line, while vibe coding tools act more like collaborators that can reason about features and architecture.

Using ChatGPT or Claude in a separate window requires manual context switching and copying code back and forth. Integrated vibe coding tools remove this friction by operating directly inside the IDE with full project awareness.

In conclusion, traditional autocomplete is best for small syntax help, Copilot is useful for accelerating known patterns, and vibe coding tools are most effective when building or evolving complete projects.
