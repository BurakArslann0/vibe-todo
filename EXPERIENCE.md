# Vibe Coding Experience

## Tool Selection Justification
I chose Cursor because it integrates AI deeply into the development environment and allows direct interaction with the project files. Its ability to understand the entire codebase made it appealing for building a complete application rather than just assisting with small code snippets.

## Development Process
I used Cursor as an AI pair programmer throughout the project. By providing a clear natural language prompt, the tool generated the core structure of the Todo List application, including components, state management, and styling. The iterative workflow allowed me to review and apply changes easily.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was setting up the local development environment correctly. Once resolved, Cursor handled most of the application logic efficiently. Some UI adjustments and testing required manual verification, but the AI significantly reduced development time.

## Reflection
Vibe coding changed my workflow by shifting focus from writing every line of code to reviewing and guiding AI-generated solutions. I was surprised by how accurately the tool understood project requirements. I would use this approach again for rapid prototyping and small to medium projects. This technology has strong potential to increase productivity while still requiring developer oversight.
